        <p class="card1__title card1__flex">I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects I learned <br> were current, if not more so, in the company I joined. I <br> honestly feel I got every penny‚Äôs worth.</p>
        <p class="card1__paragraph card1__flex">‚ÄúI was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I‚Äôve been looking to make a <br> transition and have heard some people who had an amazing experience here.I signed up for <br> the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled
            shortly thereafter. The next 12 <br> weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my life. Since completing the course, I‚Äôve <br> successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup. ‚Äù</p>

        <p class="card2__title">The team was very <br> supportive and kept me <br> motivated</p>
        <p class="card2__paragraph">‚Äú I started as a total newbie with <br> virtually no coding skills. I now work <br> as a mobile engineer for a big <br> company. This was one of the best <br> investments I‚Äôve made in myself. ‚Äù</p>

            <p class="card4__title card4__flex">Awesome teaching support from TAs who did the bootcamp <br> themselves. Getting guidance from them and learning from <br>their experiences was easy.</p>
            <p class="card4__paragraph card4__flex">‚ÄúThe staff seem genuinely concerned about my progress which I find really refreshing. The <br> program gave me the confidence necessary to be able to go out in the world and present <br> myself as a capable junior developer. The standard is
                above the rest. You will get the <br> personal attention you need from an incredible community of smart and amazing people. ‚Äù</p>

        </div>

        <p class="card5__title">Such a life-changing <br>experience. Highly <br> recommended!</p>
        <p class="card5__paragraph">‚Äú Before joining the bootcamp, I‚Äôve <br> never written a line of code. I needed <br> some structure from professionals <br> who can help me learn programming <br> step by step. I was encouraged to <br> enroll by a former student of theirs
            <br> who can only say wonderful things <br> about the program. The entire <br>curriculum and staff did not <br> disappoint. They were very hands-on <br>and I never had to wait long for <br> assistance. The agile team project, in <br> particular,
            was outstanding. It took <br> my learning to the next level in a way <br> that no tutorial could ever have. In <br> fact, I‚Äôve often referred to it during <br> interviews as an example of my <br> developent experience. It certainly
            <br> helped me land a job as a full-stack <br> developer after receiving multiple <br> offers. 100% recommend! ‚Äù</p>
